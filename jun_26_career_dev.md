#Personal Branding
Handing out a syllabus for next six weeks

Jeff Bezos -- "Your Brand is what people say about you when you're not in the room"

##Define your brand
* What do you want to be known for?
* If I search for you online, what will I find?
* Are you okay with that?

If I search for you online, will I find material that supports your story? Or will it be inconsistency.

##Knowing yourself:
* Know personal style
* Know body language
* Get feedback on how one is percieved
* Behavior - how you treat people

##Online content:
* Photos
* Posts
* Network
* Affiliations (likes, followings, groups)

##Online presence:
###Essential; non-negotiable as a developer
* LinkedIn
* GitHub
###Secondary
* Personal Website
* Facebook
* Twitter
* Instagram

Keep it simple -- if you have a question about appropriateness, omit it.

##LinkedIn
It starts with the picture.

Don't go for quirky or funny. Be self-expressive elsewhere.

###Must-do's
* Professional photo
* Accurate title; reflects expertise, not necessarily current position
* Search friendly work and experience; keyword-search friendly
* Stay active -- keep updating the profile; add projects, posts, statuses, updates
* Grow your network; probably best to grow organically
* Join relevant groups

###How much experience to share?
Think about experience a little more broadly; don't just share technically related stuff.
Use this experience to support self-story.

Summary should be a short paragraph. Tells about technical experience and personal brand.

Recruiters don't like holes or gaps in the experience. Be upfront about everything.

Asked about the hole in my experience; best way is to be confident about the story I tell, and to shape it in a postitive way.
Don't talk about "not getting a degree," talk about coursework in ""

##Github
* Connect to linked-in
* Be active
* Support peers
