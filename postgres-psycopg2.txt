My brief travails in getting postgres to work on Ubuntu-base Linux Mint:

>sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

can enter in to the postgres prompt here:
>sudo -u postgres psql postgres

and in this prompt, can set a password:
>\password postgres

exiting to BASH, can create a postgres role after my linux role here:
>sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser $USER

exit, and then:
>psql

could log me into the postgres prompt
If "user does not exist," then I don't have a postgres user linked to my Linux role
If "database does not exist," then I don't have a database with the same name as my user

can create a database after my user:
>postgres createdb `whoami`

which can be entered via
>postgres

or create a database with an arbitrary name
>sudo -u postgres createdb arbitrarilynameddb

which can be entered via
>postgres arbitrarilynameddb

can also change my prompt to serve my role as a postgres user via
>sudo -u postgres -i

The prompt prefix changes to this
postgres@jason-ThinkPad-X61

now, installing psycopg2 requires postgresql-server-dev-x.x where x.x is the version number. Get the version:
>psql -V
psql (PostgreSQL) 9.3.8

and then use apt-get tab completion to help orient towards the correct package
>sudo apt-get install postgresql-server-dev-9.3

Cris recommended installing from pip, but my Python include files aren't in the standard place:
/usr/include/

They are actually here here:
/usr/i486-linuxlibc5/include/

As an aside, everything in this directory is libc5 related. The newer libc6/glibc standard library is now placed in /usr/include

install psycopg2 using apt-get, per developer instructions:
>sudo apt-get install python-psycopg2

now make a virtual environment inheriting from 
>mkvirtualenv --system-site-packages psycopg2

now entering python and importing psycopg2 should work
>python
>import psycopg2
