## R-squared

R^2 = 1 -(SS_residual/SS_total)

SS_residual total squared error
SS_total is the mean against actual data

## Confusion Matrix
For classification problems

precision -- when we say true, how ofter are we right?
recall - when actual is True, how did we predict True?
accuracy - BAD - how often are our predictions right?

## models

* k-means cluster:  dataset and number k of clusters
* nearest neighbors: given a labeled data set, use nearest neighbors
to determine vals; GOOD - doesn't assume any structure;
BAD - doesn't assume any structure
