##Applying to Jobs

Mistakes
* Google 'python jobs Seattle'
* Monster

Example Peach
* Don't go straight to jobs
* Look for people on the website
* Sent a quick message to CEO
* Then got a redirect to contact person

Peach is small. Bigger companies? Find people in the network to reach out to.

##Schedule
* Make a sustainable schedule


##Ways to Fuck Up
* Not applying the right way
* Not keeping a consistent/sustainable schedule; example is 10-1pm M-F; better to make contacts on Mon; try one meetup per week
* Having to keep a full time job simutaneously

##Job Search Activity Log
columns = company, position, initial contact date, applied date, application follow up date, 1st interv
* Having to keep a full time job simutaneouslyiew date, 2nd "", 3rd"", comments

##Third-party Recruiters

Generalizations
Pros: can be well connected, know about jobs early, can offer resume help, know about contract jobs
Cons: poor reputation for human-interaction (sales/commission oriented), not always knowledgable, flaky

Gina has a list of good recuiters. Will send.

##Contracts vs. Full-Time
Prior contracts can give more leverage in negotiating salary

##If Not Getting the Job
Nobody contacting for interviews: contact issues, resume issues etc
Interviewing, but not offered: interview problems
